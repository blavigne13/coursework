# Traveling Salesman Problem

Course: Algorithms

Date: Fall 2015 (6th semester)

Multiple incarnations:
* Depth-first search with pruning
* Depth-first search using dynamic programming
* Nearest neighbor hueristic
* 2-opt local search hueristic
* 3-opt local search hueristic

The nearest-neighbor + 2-opt version was for a competitively-graded assignment and was the top submission in the class (approx. 50 students). Currently in the midst of heavy re-factoring to better implement principles of OOP.
